## tomcat-embedded-quickstarts

A place to keep quickstarts for Embedded Tomcat. Each example will have two flavors: Spring Boot and Embedded Tomcat proper, for those that don't want to use Spring Boot.

**TODO:** Add maven profile (would that work?) to allow users to specify JWS instead?

## Planned Quickstart Topics

* HTTP/2 (Exand APR example)
    * JSSE+Openssl
    * Java9 JSSE
* Update APR example to include SSL
* JASPIC
* Clustering

## Other Things

I'd also like to get these (and more!) examples or some variation of them up on [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/) in a course.
