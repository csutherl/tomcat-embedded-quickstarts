## tomcat-embedded-quickstarts
A temporary place to keep quickstarts for JWS tomcat. Each example will have two flavors: Spring Boot and Embedded Tomcat proper, for those that don't want to use Spring Boot.

**TODO:** Use community tomcat by default, add maven profile (would that work?) to allow users to specify JWS instead.

## Planned Quickstart Topics
* HTTP/2 (Exand APR example)
    * JSSE+Openssl
    * Java9 JSSE
* Update APR example to include SSL
* JASPIC
* Clustering

## Other Things
I'd also like to get these examples or some variation of them up on [Katacoda](https://katacoda.com/) in a course.
